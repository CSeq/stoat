NAME

stoat - STatic Object file Analysis Tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sfpv* ['OPTIONS'] FILES

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*stoat* is a LLVM based static analysis tool to verify that functions
have some listed property through the use of annotations and a basic

software, though it should eventually grow to be much more general than this.
