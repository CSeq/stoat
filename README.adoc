Realtime Function Static Analysis
---------------------------------

Based Upon a Four Pass System, callgraph information is extracted (virtual
method dispatch included) for C/C++ programs compiled to llvm IR
representations.
This information is used in conjunction with external whitelist files to find
calls to blacklisted or graylisted functions which could result in realtime
unsafe behavior.

Requires
~~~~~~~~

- Recentish LLVM 3.3+
- A version of clang which dumps *valid* llvm IR files (svn versions are known
  to produce files which will result in segfaults)
- c++filt for demangling
- ruby for doing the actual deduction logic

How To Use
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Compile all files of a given project using the -emit-llvm option
2. Annotate a function with __attribute__((annotate("realtime")))
3. Run the ruby script on the resulting llvm IR files
4. View the contradictions and either update your code or update the whitelist
5. ???
6. Profit

General LLVM Interacting Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pass 1
** Dump CallGraph information including stubs for virtual calls
* Pass 2
** Dump Inline annotations on functions/methods for safety
* Pass 3
** Extract the class hierarchy
* Pass 4
** Dump vTables which can be combined with the call graph from Pass one and
   the hierarchy from pass 3
